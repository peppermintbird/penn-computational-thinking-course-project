# penn-computational-thinking-course-project
Use computational thinking to develop and then implement an algorithm to solve the problem of counting the number of occurrences of a word and its synonyms in a corpus of text documents.

This project consists of four parts:
- Apply the four pillars of CT and describe the results of each

- Express the algorithm used in the solution using a flowchart

- Express the algorithm using a structured notation known as pseudocode

- Implement the solution in Python
